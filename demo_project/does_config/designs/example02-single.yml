# Example Goal - Demonstrate that:
#  (1) a suite can consist of multiple experiments that are executed in parallel (here 2 experiments)
#  (2) `init_role` in host_type defines an ansible role to install packages etc. on a host
#  (3) a `config.json` file with the run config is within the working directory of the `$CMD$`
#     -> can be used to pass config parameters

# experiment with two factors, each with two levels (cross-product), and two repetitions
experiment_1:
  n_repetitions: 2
  host_types:
    small:
      n: 1
      init_role: setup-small
      # runs the python script demo.py within the code directory fetched from the code repository: the demo script creates a result file in csv or json
      $CMD$: "{{ exp_code_dir }}/.venv/bin/python {{ exp_code_dir }}/demo_project/demo.py --config config.json" # (3) uses the config.json in the working dir of the command with the run config
  base_experiment:
    seed: 1234
    out: json
    payload_size_mb:
      $FACTOR$: [10, 50]
    opt:
      $FACTOR$: [True, False]


# experiment with one factor, with 5 levels, and three repetitions (each)
experiment_2:
  n_repetitions: 3
  host_types:
    small:
      n: 1
      init_role: setup-small
      # (3) uses the config.json in cmd but also passes arguments on the command line
      $CMD$: "{{ exp_code_dir }}/.venv/bin/python {{ exp_code_dir }}/demo_project/demo.py --config config.json --type [% my_run.problem.type %] --size [% my_run.problem.size %]"

  base_experiment:
    out: csv
    problem:
      type: abc
      size:
        $FACTOR$: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
